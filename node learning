Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
What is node js used for?
Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. 
It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.
